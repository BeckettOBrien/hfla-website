### Overview
As a GitHub Action, I want to ensure that all of my fellow GitHub Actions' dependencies are up-to-date so that they don't unexpectedly break.

### Action Items
- [ ] Check all GitHub actions' dependencies for updates
  - Maybe add a list of actions with links to their files?
- [ ] Create issues to update any out-of-date dependencies

### Resources/Instructions
Maybe explain how to check dependencies for updates?
